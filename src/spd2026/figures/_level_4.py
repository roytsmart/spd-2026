    Loop over the :math:`\text{O\,V}\;630\,\AA` scene ESIS recovered.

    This is the flight, not a simulation of it: the Level-4 product is the
    time-dependent MART inversion of the thirty Level-1 exposures, on a grid
    of three quarters of an arcsecond and seventeen and a half kilometers per
    second, registered to the sky so that a feature fixed on the Sun stays
    put from one frame to the next.

    The scene is drawn as a false-color image, where the hue is the Doppler
    velocity, on the same color scale as the figures of the synthetic scene.
    A color therefore means the same thing here as it does there, and what
    ESIS actually recovered can be held against what it was expected to.

    The whole field is shown, which is some fourteen arcminutes across,
    where the figures built from the IRIS raster cover a couple of
    arcminutes of it.

    Parameters
    ----------
    path_data
        The Level-4 file to read.
        If :obj:`None`, a local copy if one exists and the published copy on
        the share otherwise, see :obj:`path_level_4_default`.
    center
        The place on the sky to look at.
        If :obj:`None`, the whole field. :obj:`position_event_e` is where
        the event studied so far sits.
    radius
        The half width of the region shown when `center` is given.
    center_box
        The middle of a region to outline on the image.

        The region the close-up figures look at, so that a reader can see
        where in the field the event they are about sits. If :obj:`None`,
        no box is drawn, which is what a figure already cropped to that
        region wants.
    radius_box
        The half width of the outlined region.
    color_box
        The color to outline it in. Outlined in black underneath, so that it
        is visible against the bright parts of the image as well as the dark.
    linewidth_box
        The width of the outline.
    unit_intensity
        The unit of the brightness axis of the key, see
        :func:`_energy_photon`. Per angstrom, since this figure shows the
        spectrum rather than the light of the line added up.
    index_time_reference
        The frame whose brightness sets the color scale of every frame.
        The default is the frame the distortion fit was optimized against,
        which is also near the middle of the flight, where the rocket is
        highest and the signal is strongest. The frames at either end are
        therefore dimmer, as they were.
    velocity_color
        The Doppler velocity mapped to each end of the visible spectrum,
        which is the range the other figures use.
    percentile
        The percentile of the reference frame placed at the top of the
        brightness scale, separately at each wavelength.
    figsize
        The width and height of the figure in inches.
    dpi
        The resolution of the saved animation in dots per inch.
    fps
        The number of frames per second in the saved animation.
    timestamp
        Whether to write the time of each exposure above the image.
    suffix
        The file type of the animation, either ``".mp4"`` or ``".gif"``.
        Ignored if `path` is given.
    path
        The location to save the animation.
        If :obj:`None`, it is saved alongside the other figures.

    Notes
    -----
    The radiometry of the four channels is relative rather than absolute,
    so the structure and the velocities of this scene are to be trusted
    further than its brightness.

    Loop over the Doppler shift ESIS recovered.

    The same flight as :func:`level_4`, reduced from a spectrum at every
    place on the sky to a single number: the median of the line profile,
    which is the velocity that half the light of that pixel is moving faster
    than and half slower.

    Drawn the way a Doppler shift is conventionally drawn: blue where the
    plasma is coming toward us, red where it is going away, and white where
    it is at rest. The two signs then separate at a glance rather than
    having to be read off a ramp, and, since the quiet Sun is near rest, the
    background settles into the pale middle of the colormap instead of into
    a busy mid-tone.

    The range is a great deal narrower than the range of the spectrum: the
    line moves by a few kilometers per second almost everywhere, so a scale
    reaching the ends of the recovered spectrum would leave the whole field
    the same shade of gray.

    Parameters
    ----------
    path_data
        The Level-4 file to read.
        If :obj:`None`, a local copy if one exists and the published copy on
        the share otherwise, see :obj:`path_level_4_default`.
    center
        The place on the sky to look at.
        If :obj:`None`, the whole field. :obj:`position_event_e` is where
        the event studied so far sits.
    radius
        The half width of the region shown when `center` is given.
    velocity_limit
        The Doppler velocity at each end of the colormap.
    cmap
        The colormap.
        One which runs through white at its middle, since the quantity is
        signed and its middle is where the plasma is at rest.
    color_bad
        The color of the places with no median to report.
        Outside the field stop no light was recorded, so the median of
        nothing is nothing. It has to be a color the colormap itself never
        takes, or those places would read as a velocity: the middle of a
        diverging colormap is white, so white would say the plasma was at
        rest rather than absent.
    figsize
        The width and height of the figure in inches.
    dpi
        The resolution of the saved animation in dots per inch.
    fps
        The number of frames per second in the saved animation.
    timestamp
        Whether to write the time of each exposure above the image.
    suffix
        The file type of the animation, either ``".mp4"`` or ``".gif"``.
        Ignored if `path` is given.
    path
        The location to save the animation.
        If :obj:`None`, it is saved alongside the other figures.

    Notes
    -----
    A median is only as meaningful as the profile it is taken of. Where the
    line is faint the profile is mostly noise and so is its median, which is
    why the faintest places look like static rather than like plasma.

def _intensity(a: "esis.data.Level_4") -> na.AbstractScalarArray:
    r"""
    The light of each line window, integrated over its Doppler range.

    :attr:`esis.data.Level_4.intensity` adds the cells of a window together
    without multiplying by the width of a cell, so what it returns is still a
    spectral radiance: its unit keeps the :math:`\text{\AA}^{-1}` that an
    integral over wavelength would have cancelled.

    Each window is a grid uniform in Doppler velocity about its own rest
    wavelength, so its cells are all one width, and that width is the only
    thing the sum is missing. The windows do not share it, though, running
    from :math:`0.0341\,\text{\AA}` at He I to :math:`0.0368\,\text{\AA}` at
    O V, so leaving it out is not one constant factor across the lines but
    five different ones, and the lines cannot be held against each other
    until it is put back.

    An AIA image of the same field at the same moment as each ESIS frame.

    AIA takes a full disk every twelve seconds and ESIS took a frame every
    ten, so there is an AIA image within a few seconds of every ESIS one, and
    the nearest is the one taken. The two instruments are not synchronized,
    so the offset wanders through the flight rather than being fixed.

    The images are registered, which turns them solar north up on a common
    plate scale of six tenths of an arcsecond and puts disk center at the
    reference pixel. That leaves a grid which is separable and identical from
    one frame to the next, so the crop to the ESIS field is worked out once
    and the rest is slicing.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a
        The Level-4 product whose frames are to be matched.
    wavelength
        The AIA channel.
    tolerance
        How far from an ESIS frame to look for an AIA one.
        Half the AIA cadence would do; a little more, so that a frame is
        found even where the two instruments drift furthest apart.
    center
        The place on the sky to crop to.
        If :obj:`None`, the whole field ESIS saw.
    radius
        The half width of the crop when `center` is given.

    Notes
    -----
    Every frame is a separate query, which is slower than asking for the
    whole flight at once but holds only one full disk in memory at a time:
    thirty of them would be four gigabytes, where thirty crops are a quarter
    of that.

    An HMI magnetogram of the same field at the same moment as each ESIS

    HMI takes forty five seconds to build a magnetogram where ESIS took ten

    magnetograms cover the whole flight, and each stands for the four or five
    ESIS frames nearest it. The field is what it is doing over the flight
    rather than what it is doing in a given second, which is the right way
    round for it, since the field of the quiet Sun does not turn over in
    five minutes.

    Unlike AIA there is no registration step, so the grid is what HMI
    recorded on: a rotation of a hundred and eighty degrees and a fraction,
    which makes the coordinates of a pixel depend on both of its indices. The
    positions are therefore returned as a mesh rather than as an extent.

    Loop over the intensity of every line ESIS recovered.

    The Level-4 product is inverted one spectral window at a time and

    as a single product of several lines. This shows the intensity of each,
    the light of that window integrated over its Doppler range, so that the
    same moment of the flight can be seen in every line at once.

    The lines are formed at very different temperatures, from the
    chromosphere to the corona, so what changes between the panels is which
    part of the atmosphere is being looked at rather than which part of the
    Sun.

    Each panel is scaled to itself. The lines differ in brightness by far
    more than the structure within any one of them, so a single scale would
    leave the faint windows black; the price is that the panels say which
    structures appear in which line rather than which line is brighter.

    The last panel is AIA rather than ESIS, cropped to the same field and
    matched frame for frame. It is there to be recognized: AIA 304 is a
    channel everybody has looked at, so it says whether what ESIS recovered
    is the Sun that was there, and its own line is He II 304, which is formed
    near where He I 584 is and can be read against it.

    r"""
    Loop over one event in every line ESIS recovered, and in context.

    The whole of what was measured of one place on the Sun, at once. The top
    row is the intensity of each line, the middle row is the Doppler shift of
    the same line directly beneath it, and the bottom row is what the two
    instruments watching the same place from orbit saw: AIA in its
    :math:`304\,\text{\AA}` channel, two coronal ones, and an HMI magnetogram.

    Reading down a column says what one line is doing and how fast; reading
    across the top row says which temperatures it is doing it at; and the
    bottom row says what the field there looks like, which is what an
    explosive event is supposed to be about.

    The rows are scaled differently on purpose. Each intensity panel is
    scaled to itself, since the lines differ in brightness by far more than
    the structure within any one of them. Every Doppler panel shares one
    scale, so a color means one velocity across the whole row and the lines
    can be read against each other.

    Parameters
    ----------
    path_data
        The directory of Level-4 files to read.
        If :obj:`None`, the directory the local copies are kept in.
    center
        The place on the sky to look at.
        If :obj:`None`, :obj:`position_event_e`.
    radius
        The half width of the region shown.
    wavelength_aia
        The AIA channels drawn in the bottom row, one panel each.

        Four by default, in order of the temperature they are formed at,
        as the rows above them are: 304 is the He II line, formed near the
        coolest of the ESIS lines, 131 sits between that and the rest, and
        171 and 193 are coronal, formed above the hottest of them.
    unit_intensity
        The unit to draw the intensities in, see :func:`_energy_photon`.
    percentile
        The percentile of each line placed at the top of its own brightness
        scale.
    velocity_limit
        The Doppler velocity at each end of the middle row's colormap.
    magnetogram_limit
        The field strength at each end of the magnetogram's colormap.
        Far below the strongest fields present, since otherwise everything
        but the strongest is the same shade of grey.
    cmap
        The colormap of the intensities and of the magnetogram.
    cmap_velocity
        The colormap of the Doppler shifts.
        One which runs through white at its middle, since the quantity is
        signed and its middle is where the plasma is at rest.
    color_bad
        The color of the places with no Doppler shift to report.
    figsize
        The width and height of the figure in inches.
    dpi
        The resolution of the saved animation in dots per inch.
    fps
        The number of frames per second in the saved animation.
    timestamp
        Whether to write the time of each exposure above the panels.
    suffix
        The file type of the animation, either ``".mp4"`` or ``".gif"``.
        Ignored if `path` is given.
    path
        The location to save the animation.
        If :obj:`None`, it is saved alongside the other figures.

    Notes
    -----
    The three rows are not on the same clock. ESIS took a frame every ten
    seconds and AIA takes one every twelve, so those two step together, but a
    magnetogram takes forty five seconds to build and one of them therefore
    stands for several ESIS frames at a time.

    The fastest plasma of a line in every frame, both ways, and where it is.

    In each frame the region is searched for the place with the most negative
    Doppler shift and the place with the most positive one, and both are
    reported along with where they are and how bright the line is there. A
    place is followed rather than held still, so what these say is what
    happened to the flow rather than what happened at a point the flow may
    have left.

    Only the brighter part of the region is searched: the median of a faint
    profile is mostly noise, and the largest velocities in a map are
    otherwise always found where there is the least light to measure them
    with.

        The Level-4 product to search.

    r"""
    How fast the event was going, in every line, against time.

    In each frame the region around the event is searched for the place where
    the plasma is coming toward us fastest and the place where it is going
    away fastest, in each line separately. The lower panel is those two
    speeds and the upper panel is how bright the line is where they were
    found, so the two panels describe the same places throughout.

    The places are followed rather than held still, which is the only way to
    ask what happened to the flow: the blue-shifted side of this event
    travels some eleven arcseconds over four minutes, and a fixed point it
    has left reads as plasma coming to rest when the plasma has only gone
    somewhere else.

    The panels on the right are one line at one moment, with the two places
    it was followed to marked, and with the region searched drawn on them:
    a bluer place outside that region is not a place the search could have
    found.

    Parameters
    ----------
    path_data
        The directory of Level-4 files to read.
        If :obj:`None`, the directory the local copies are kept in.
    time_reference
        The moment the panels on the right are of, when not animated.
    num_frames_dropped
        How many frames to leave off the end of the flight.

        By the last frames the rocket is low and the signal has fallen to a
        tenth of what it was at the top, and the search stops finding plasma:
        the extreme runs out to the end of the spectral window, which is a
        report on the noise rather than on the Sun.
    num_frames_unscaled
        How many frames at the end to draw without letting them set the
        velocity scale.

        The same decline, one frame earlier: the last frame kept is worth
        showing but is already running away, and a scale wide enough to hold
        it leaves everything before it squashed flat. It is drawn, and the
        limits are taken from the frames before it.
    label_line
        The line shown on the right, and whose places are marked.
    center
        The middle of the region to search.
        If :obj:`None`, :obj:`position_event_e`.
    radius
        The half width of the region to search, about `center`.

        If :obj:`None`, the whole of what is shown is searched, which is the
        only setting under which a place visibly bluer than the marked one
        cannot appear in the panel. A number here searches a box of that half
        width instead, which keeps the extremes to one event at the cost of
        being able to find a faster one just outside it.
    radius_image
        The half width of the region shown on the right, and the region
        searched when `radius` is :obj:`None`.
    offset_image
        How far north of `center` to put the region shown on the right.

        The event does not stay where it was found: the blue-shifted side
        travels north through the flight, so a region centered on where it
        started leaves it against the top edge by the end. Only what is shown
        is moved, not where the places were looked for.
    percentile_bright
        The percentile of the intensity below which a place is too faint for
        its Doppler shift to be believed.
    percentile
        The percentile of the intensity placed at the top of the brightness
        scale of the panel on the right.
    gamma
        The power the intensity is raised to before it is turned into a
        brightness. One half is the square root, which is the usual way of
        showing a quiet Sun beside something much brighter than it: the event
        is an order of magnitude above the network around it, and on a linear
        scale everything but the event is nearly black. One leaves the
        brightness proportional to the intensity.
    velocity_limit
        The Doppler velocity at each end of the colormap on the right.
    unit_intensity
        The unit to draw the intensities in, see :func:`_energy_photon`.
    normalize
        Whether to divide each line by what it was doing over the whole field
        at the same moment, which costs the intensity its units and leaves a
        ratio.

        Off by default, so that the panel is in the units the product is in
        and the numbers on it are the radiance that was measured. The price
        is that the signal rises and falls through the flight as the rocket
        climbs out of the atmosphere and falls back into it, by a factor of
        two on the way up and a factor of ten on the way down, and that
        envelope is a large part of what these curves do with time. Turn this
        on to divide it out and see how the places behaved against the rest
        of the Sun instead.
    animated
        Whether to save an animation instead of a still.

        The panels on the right then step through the flight and a cursor
        runs across the curves, so that the shape of the event and the
        numbers taken from it are seen at the same moment.
    cmap
        The colormap of the intensity panel.
    cmap_velocity
        The colormap of the Doppler panel.
    figsize
        The width and height of the figure in inches.
    dpi
        The resolution of the saved figure in dots per inch.
    fps
        The number of frames per second, if `animated`.
    suffix
        The file type.
        If :obj:`None`, ``".mp4"`` when `animated` and ``".svg"`` otherwise.
    path
        The location to save the figure.
        If :obj:`None`, it is saved alongside the other figures.

    Notes
    -----
    An extreme is bounded below by the noise: it is the largest of many
    numbers, so it can never come out at zero however quiet the Sun is. What
    these curves can say is that one line is faster than another, or that a
    line is faster now than it was; they cannot say that nothing is
    happening.

    The intensities are drawn on a logarithmic scale, since the lines differ
    in brightness by more than an order of magnitude and on a linear scale
    the faint ones would be flat against the bottom of the panel.

    r"""
    How fast the event moved, across the sky as well as along the line of
    sight.

    The companion to :func:`level_4_event_history`, which asks how fast the
    plasma was going toward us. The same two places are followed, the ones
    where the line is most blue-shifted and most red-shifted, and here what
    is asked is how fast those places themselves travelled across the sky,
    and what the two speeds come to together.

    A panel for each direction, and in each of them both speeds at once. The
    speed across the sky is nearly all of the total, so the two curves lie
    almost on top of one another and the gap between them, shaded, is
    everything the Doppler shift contributes.

    On the right the same field is drawn twice, its brightness and its
    Doppler shift, with the two places marked on both, so that what the
    numbers on the left are measurements of can be seen directly.

    Parameters
    ----------
    path_data
        The directory of Level-4 files to read.
        If :obj:`None`, the directory the local copies are kept in.
    time_reference
        The moment the panels on the right are of, when not animated.
    num_frames_dropped
        How many frames to leave off the end of the flight, see
        :func:`level_4_event_history`.
    num_frames_unscaled
        How many frames at the end to draw without letting them set the
        scale.
    label_line
        The line shown on the right, and whose places are marked.
    center
        The middle of the region to search.
        If :obj:`None`, :obj:`position_event_e`.
    radius
        The half width of the region to search.
        If :obj:`None`, the whole of what is shown.
    radius_image
        The half width of the region shown on the right.
    offset_image
        How far north of `center` to put the region shown on the right.
    percentile_bright
        The percentile of the intensity below which a place is too faint for
        its Doppler shift to be believed.
    percentile
        The percentile of the intensity placed at the top of the brightness
        scale of the panel on the right.
    gamma
        The power the intensity is raised to before it is turned into a
        brightness. One half is the square root, which is the usual way of
        showing a quiet Sun beside something much brighter than it: the event
        is an order of magnitude above the network around it, and on a linear
        scale everything but the event is nearly black. One leaves the
        brightness proportional to the intensity.
    velocity_limit
        The Doppler velocity at each end of the colormap on the right.
    speed_limit
        The speed at the top of the two panels on the left.

        The curves are mostly quiet and occasionally leave the plot
        altogether, in the frames where the place being followed stops being
        one feature and becomes another. A scale wide enough to hold those
        excursions leaves the quiet stretches, which are the measurement,
        flat against the bottom. They are drawn and clipped instead. If
        :obj:`None`, the scale is taken from the data.
    animated
        Whether to save an animation instead of a still.
    cmap
        The colormap of the intensity panel.
    cmap_velocity
        The colormap of the Doppler panel.
    figsize
        The width and height of the figure in inches.
    dpi
        The resolution of the saved figure in dots per inch.
    fps
        The number of frames per second, if `animated`.
    suffix
        The file type.
        If :obj:`None`, ``".mp4"`` when `animated` and ``".svg"`` otherwise.
    path
        The location to save the figure.
        If :obj:`None`, it is saved alongside the other figures.

    Notes
    -----
    The place followed is the one where the line is most shifted anywhere in
    the field, found afresh in every frame and with nothing tying it to where
    it was in the frame before. That is the right definition for a Doppler
    shift and the wrong one for a speed across the sky: when the fastest
    place stops being one feature and starts being another, the position
    jumps, and a jump divided by ten seconds is a very large number. A cell
    is half a megameter, so one cell of jump is already fifty kilometers per
    second, and the field is seventy-eight cells across.

    These speeds are therefore a lower bound on nothing and an upper bound on
    nothing; they say how far apart the two extremes were from one frame to
    the next. Read them together with the running difference beside them,
    which shows whether anything actually moved.
